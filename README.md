# Super Learner Bros – AI Learning Adventure

An interactive, retro-platformer learning experience that teaches adults how to learn faster with AI.

## Overview

Super Learner Bros is a playable mini-course for AI-curious adults. It turns proven AI learning patterns into a simple world of levels, tricks, and "prompt recipes" they can re-use. The experience feels like a Mario-style world map, but every click helps the user understand new topics faster, break real tasks into steps, evaluate AI tools, and remember more.
